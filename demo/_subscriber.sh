# The body of terminals 2, 3 and 4: one named subscriber.
#
# Equivalent of `nats sub greet`. --tail matches NATS core semantics —
# only messages published while this subscriber is running are delivered,
# so the log's backlog is skipped.
#
# Nothing here polls. `sukkal sub` starts a small HTTP server of its own,
# tells the broker to POST matching messages to it, and prints them as
# they land — so a message shows up in well under a millisecond rather
# than on the next tick of a poll.
#
# DURABLE=1 switches to a read-receipt subscription instead: the broker
# persists how far this subscriber has acknowledged, so stopping it and
# starting it again delivers exactly what it missed. --tail then only
# decides where it joins the very first time.
